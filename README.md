I used Navigation compose for screen navigation and shared viewmodel.

Tech Stack and Open-Source Libraries

1. Minimum SDK level 23

2. Kotlin

3. Jetpack Compose - Toolkit for building UI in declarative manner

4. Navigation Compose - Implement navigation in app

5. Dependency Injection -
   Dagger Hilt - it simplifies the whole process and reduces the unnecessary steps without losing any of the features of the original Dagger..
   Hilt-ViewModel - DI for injecting ViewModel.

6. ViewModel - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.

7. Single Activity Architecture - SAA has one activity with Navigation Component and fragments.
